#  Design and Implementation of a Digital Twin for a CubeSat


I am working in a Meng project which involves creating digital twin which can be modified for specific purposes.

My sub-system involves regulating the internal and external temperatures of the CubeSat to maintain it in a optimum range. This can be achieved by using active or/and passive thermal control systems. 

Results for the heater are shown below:
